Changelog
=========

16.0 (unreleased)
-----------------

* Support relationship queries and other queries that may return multiple
  types of objects.  Object type descriptions (required for marshalling
  field values into the correct Python type) are cached after the first
  time they are used.  Thanks to Melnychuk Taras of Quintagroup.

* Queries now return a list-like QueryRecordSet holding a sequence of dict-like
  QueryRecord objects, instead of a dict containing a list of dicts.  This
  allows for more Pythonic access such as results[0].Id instead of
  results['results'][0]['Id'].  The old syntax should still work.  Thanks to
  Melnychuk Taras of Quintagroup.
